# Agent loop guidance (read before changing loop nodes)

Read this before adding, removing, or renaming any node in the agent loop pipeline or its diagram.

## The live loop visualizer is ONE shared controller, two mounts

The streaming loop visualizer (`ui/main-panel/agents/agent-loop/js/loop-logic.js`) is a reusable controller, **`createLoopView(opts)`** — do **not** fork it. Two places mount it:

| Mount | File | Source | Gate |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| **Primary** — the agent card's **Agent Loop** tab | `ui/main-panel/agents/js/tab-agent-loop.js` | the active chat session | streams **only when** `app.currentAgentId === agent.id` (the active chat's agent matches the card); otherwise draws the static blueprint + a hint. Keeps node-click → edit panels and the Run test pill as a fallback. |
| **Secondary** — the admin **Runtime Loop** page | `ui/admin-tools/runtime-loop/runtime-loop-view.js` | the active chat session | none (always follows the active session). |

How it fits together:

- `createLoopView(opts)` holds **all** per-view state (pages, buffers, node states, panels). Each mount passes its own `getGraphArea` / `getPages` / `getSidebar` elements, a `gate()`, an `onBlocked()` (what to show when gated off), `isAlive()` (auto-destroys when its DOM is gone), an optional `onNodeClick` override, and a unique `markerPrefix` (admin `lv`, agent tab `agl`) so two diagrams never clash on SVG marker IDs.
- The old module functions — `initLoopVisual`, `startLoopVisual`, `stopLoopVisual`, `renderRuntimeLoopSidebar`, `loopVisualSessionChanged` — are **kept as thin wrappers**: they drive the admin view and fan session-changes out to **every** live view. Their callers (`main.js`, `files.js`, `session-init`/`session-core`, `optimizer-stats`) need no changes.
- The WebSocket handler `app._loopVisualHandler` fans each event to **all** live views; each view's own `gate()` + `isAlive()` decide whether to act.
- The graph chrome is styled by **both** id and class so the agent tab can host its own copy: every `#loop-visual-…` rule in `loop-visual.css` is paired with a `.loop-visual-…` class selector — keep them paired.

## Agent loop diagram — keep both views in sync

The agent loop diagram (`ui/js/loop-diagram.js`) has **two completely independent, hardcoded layouts**. Adding or changing any node requires updating **both**:

| Layout | Location in file | Description |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Horizontal | `LOOP_NODES` array + `LOOP_EDGES` | Used when the diagram is zoomed out |
| Vertical | Inline array inside `buildVerticalLayout()` | Used when the diagram is zoomed in |

Neither layout is derived from the other. A node missing from one view simply won't render there.

**Full checklist for adding a new loop node:**

1. `LOOP_NODES` array — add node with correct `cx`, `cy`, `hw`, `hh`
2. `LOOP_EDGES` — wire in/out edges
3. `_H_GROUPS` — add node ID to the correct stage group (controls horizontal compression)
4. `buildVerticalLayout()` inline array — add node with correct `cy`, `hw`, `hh`; shift all subsequent `cy` values down; extend stage band `y2`; update `genuiH`
5. Update the comment at the top of `buildVerticalLayout()` with the new node count
6. `ui/js/loop-logic.js` `eventToNodeId()` — add a `case` mapping the pipeline event name to the node ID
7. `ui/loop-nodes.json` — add entries to `NODE_STATIC_ITEMS` and `NODE_PANEL_INFO`
8. `ui/js/agents.js` `_INFO_NODES` set — add node ID if it should show info-only panel (no edit bar)
9. `app/agent/loop_executor.py` `DEFAULT_NODE_ORDER` list — add node in the correct position
10. All agent JSON templates in `app/defaults/agents/` (or a `data/agents/` override) — add node ID to each `loop_logic` array
11. Any existing agents' `loop_logic` DB field — update via migration or seed script

## The `attachment_describe` node is a capability-driven type-router

`attachment_describe` (in `app/api/chat.py` `_maybe_describe_images`) is no longer
image-specific glue — it is the **attachment type-router**. It maps each attached
file to the ability that handles its mime-type (today: images → Image Vision; future
document/video abilities drop in the same way) via `app/agent/attachment_router.py`,
then picks a path from the agent's *actual* model capability
(`media_routing` / `model_sees_images` in `app/admin/settings.py`):

- **inline** — the turn model can see the media → leave it inlined;
- **describe** — it can't, but the handling ability + a capable worker model exist →
  one-shot describe (synchronous), folded into the user turn with guidance;
- **unreadable** — the ability is off or no capable model is configured → DO NOT
  inline; the "you can't read this; tell the user, don't hallucinate" directive is
  given to the model for that turn **and surfaced as a foldable `route_attachment`
  tool row** (carrying the reason: `ability_disabled` vs `no_vision_model`), but it
  is **not** written into the user's message row — so it never shows in the chat
  bubble. The directive's wording attributes the gap to the *ability being off / no
  vision model*, not to a model limitation. Same rule for the **describe** path's
  guidance *note*: the image description is persisted into the turn (kept across
  turns), but the agent-directive note is delivered to the model only — not the bubble.

Both foldable rows (`process_image` for describe, `route_attachment` for unreadable)
are **persisted as `role=tool` interaction rows** (parent = the user turn, mirroring
`memory_search`), so they survive a reload instead of being live-only stream events.
They carry **`tool_call_id = None`**, which keeps these synthetic rows out of the
model's rebuilt history (`interactions_to_openai_messages` drops un-paired tool rows)
— a *real* model-issued `process_image` call has a `tool_call_id` and is kept. On
reload, the describe path's folded `[Attached image — …]` block is **stripped from the
user bubble for display** (`_strip_folded_attachments` in `app/api/db_viewer.py`) and
shown via the `process_image` row instead; the raw folded row is left intact for the
model path (`fetch_interactions`), so the description still persists across turns.

**Rendering the foldable row (both render paths must agree).** Because these rows
have no assistant `tool_call` to pair against, the normal renderer — which matches
tool results to an assistant's saved `tool_calls` — skips them. They are rendered
explicitly instead, as their own foldable tool-only bubble in chronological
position. **This same "synthetic standalone tool" machinery also renders the
loop-node memory tools** — `memory_search` (before the turn, parented to the user)
and `memory_save` (after the turn, parented to the search row, tagged
`metadata.brain`) — so brain reads/writes show up in the transcript just like any
other tool call (search before the reply, save after):
- **Reload:** `/session-messages` tags every such row `_synth_tool` — vision by
  parent role == user, memory by `tool_name ∈ {memory_search, memory_save}` +
  `metadata.brain` — and keeps its body even in light mode (`_slim` exemption); the
  chat builds a call entry straight from the row (`_buildSynthCall` /
  `_isSynthToolRow` in `ui/chat-side-panel/js/session-load.js`) — no lazy
  `/session-turn-detail` fetch.
- **Live:** these calls fire outside a reply bubble's normal tool accounting —
  vision/`memory_search` during ingestion (before `turn_start`), `memory_save`
  *after* the turn's `response`. `chat-activity.js` therefore renders them
  out-of-band via `_renderSynthToolBubble`, drawing the completed call straight
  onto the transcript the moment it finishes, independent of turn accounting, so it
  survives every event ordering. Args arrive per-tool: vision via its `tool_call`
  event, `memory_search` via `memory_search_start` (rendered on its `tool_result`),
  `memory_save` via the args+result the backend rides on `memory_save_end`. Regular
  tool calls are unaffected.
The pasted image **thumbnail** likewise re-renders on reload: `/session-messages`
resolves the user row's `input.attachment_ids` into a frontend-shaped
`attachments` array (read from the RAW input column so it survives light mode) and
`session-load.js` re-renders it with the same component the live send flow uses.

A new file-type ability adds itself by shipping a companion `<ability>.json`
(`handles` + `worker_system` + `guidance`) next to its `.py` — **no edit to this
node**. The node id and its pipeline events (`attachment_describe_start/end`) are
unchanged, so the loop diagram needs no update.
