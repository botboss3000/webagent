"""Image Vision ability — SELF-CONTAINED drop-in.

READS images for the agent (it does NOT generate them — that's the separate
``image_generation`` ability — and it no longer switches the agent's model —
that's the separate ``model_switcher`` ability). One tool:

  • ``process_image`` — the agent's own model often can't see images (a text-only
    or tool-only model). This tool DELEGATES one image question to a vision-capable
    model (the row ticked Image-in in App Config → Models) via a tools-free one-shot
    worker, and returns the answer. The main agent never pauses; for a sharper
    answer it simply calls again with a tighter prompt (fresh worker each time —
    cheaper and simpler than a long-lived sub-conversation).

For SUSTAINED image work the agent can instead TAKE OVER on a vision model rather
than delegating every turn — but that is the Model Switcher ability's job now:
``set_model('<vision model>')`` (and ``set_model('default')`` to revert). When the
Model Switcher ability is enabled, the attachment router's describe-mode note tells
the agent it has that option; when it isn't, the note steers it to ``process_image``.

Drop-in contract: FEATURE descriptor + build_tools()/TOOL_SCHEMAS/DESTRUCTIVE,
discovered generically by app/tools/loader.py. See plugins/abilities/_TEMPLATE.py.
