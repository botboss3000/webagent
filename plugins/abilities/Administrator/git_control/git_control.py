"""Git Control ability - SELF-CONTAINED drop-in.

Structured git operations only (no shell / file / python access) - the entire
surface is git_tool, resolve_conflict and commit_and_push. These handlers are
defined HERE, in this ability file (`_inject_git_tools` below): Git Control is
the only thing that uses them, so they are NOT kept in the shared admin library.
Only genuinely shared, multi-use infra is reused from `plugins/admin`: the
`adapter.extract_injected` bridge (used by every admin ability) and the low-level
path/subprocess helpers (`_safe_path` / `_write_file_direct` / `_run_subprocess`,
which the file & shell tools use too). `extract_injected` runs the injector
against a throwaway dict and adapts its ToolInfo objects into the (handlers,
schemas, destructive) triple the generic drop-in loader contract wants, so
schemas/flags never drift.

Discovered generically by core (see app/tools/loader.py "Self-contained ability
tools"): build_tools() returns its handlers and the loader reads the
module-level TOOL_SCHEMAS / DESTRUCTIVE populated below AFTER the call.

Background watcher (the "Notify me about repo changes" setting):
  When an agent has Git Control enabled AND its ``notify_repo_changes`` setting
  turned on, this ability's ``start_background`` service quietly polls the repo
  on a cadence and, when the working tree newly diverges from the latest commit
  (uncommitted edits) or local commits sit unpushed, drops a PASSIVE heads-up
  message into that agent's most-recent chat session. No agent turn runs — it's
  an FYI, persisted so it shows when the user returns to that chat and broadcast
  live (``repo_change_notice``) so an open tab renders it immediately. Started/
  stopped by the leader-gated "ability-background" service in app/main.py via the
  generic ``background_service_hooks`` discovery — no core wiring. See
  ui/shared/js/agentWs.js (case 'repo_change_notice') for the front-end render.
