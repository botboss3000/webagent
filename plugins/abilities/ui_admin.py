"""UI Admin ability — SELF-CONTAINED drop-in.

File editing confined to ``ui/`` (.css / .html only) — no shell, python, git, or
restart. Handlers live in the shared admin library (``plugins/admin/ui_tools.py``
via ``inject_ui_tools``, which wraps the source tools behind ``ui_guardrails``);
the shared ``plugins/admin/adapter.extract_injected`` runs the injector against a
throwaway dict and adapts its ToolInfo objects into the (handlers, schemas,
destructive) triple the generic drop-in loader contract wants, so schemas/flags
never drift.

Discovered generically by core (see app/tools/loader.py "Self-contained ability
tools"): build_tools() returns its handlers and the loader reads the
module-level TOOL_SCHEMAS / DESTRUCTIVE populated below AFTER the call.
