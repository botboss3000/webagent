"""Context Control ability — SELF-CONTAINED drop-in (default context strategy).

Context Control is a *context-management strategy*: it decides how the stored
transcript is shaped into the message list sent to the model, and surfaces a
"how full is my context" gauge each turn. At the configured target it folds the
oldest turns into a rolling summary (compaction). Nothing is ever deleted — the raw
turns stay in the ``interactions`` table and remain searchable.

This file is the **plugin shell**: it exposes the *context-strategy contract*
below (the gauge + automatic background compaction) and adds ONE agent-facing
tool, ``compact_context``, for *deliberate* self-compaction. The actual engine
still lives in core agent infrastructure (``app/agent/context_control.py`` and
``app/agent/compaction.py``) because the loop and history assembly call it on
every turn — this module simply delegates to it, making Context Control the
default implementation behind a generic seam.

``compact_context`` lets the agent fold its own older turns into the rolling
summary on demand — meant for the rare checkpoint in a big, multi-step project
where it has just finished a self-contained phase and wants to free room before
the next one. It forces a compaction *now* (past the automatic threshold, and
even if background auto-compaction is switched off), but keeps the same safe
verbatim "hot tail" and user-turn-boundary rules, so nothing is lost — the raw
turns stay in the ``interactions`` table and remain searchable. The companion
``context_control.skill.md`` carries the "when is this worth it" judgement and
how to search back through memory for any detail that scrolled out of view.

Why a contract instead of a hard-wired import: context strategies are swappable
and **pick-one**. Drop in a different ability that also sets ``CONTEXT_STRATEGY``
(e.g. a sliding-window or retrieval-recall strategy), enable it *instead* of this
one, and the loop/history use it with no core edits. The resolver lives in
``app/abilities/__init__.py`` (``context_strategy_for_agent``), mirroring how
``turn_hooks_for_agent`` dispatches ``TURN_HOOK`` abilities.

Contract a context-strategy runtime may expose (all optional except the marker):
  * ``CONTEXT_STRATEGY = True`` — marks this module as a context strategy.
  * ``async CONTEXT_SETTINGS(db, agent_id, session_id=None, user_id=None) -> dict``
    — resolve settings for the agent, including an ``enabled`` flag. Returns
    ``{"enabled": False, ...}`` when the ability is off. ``session_id``/``user_id``
    let it size ``token_limit`` to the run's active model (else it falls back to
    the stored limit).
  * ``async CONTEXT_COMPACT(db, user_id, session_id, settings) -> dict | None`` —
    the write side: persist any reshaping of the stored history (here: fold old
    turns into the rolling summary). No-op / ``None`` when nothing changed.
  * ``CONTEXT_STATUS(messages, settings) -> dict | None`` — the gauge: returns
    ``{"line", "tokens", "limit", "pct"}`` to inject into the system prompt and
    emit to the UI, or ``None`` to inject nothing.
  * ``async CONTEXT_ASSEMBLE(db, user_id, session_id, rows, settings) -> list | None``
    — OPTIONAL full override of history assembly. Return the message list to send,
    or ``None`` to fall through to the default assembly (summary marker + tail).
    This default strategy does NOT implement it: its compaction persists a
    ``session_summaries`` marker that the default assembly already understands, so
    no override is needed. A window/retrieval strategy would implement this.
