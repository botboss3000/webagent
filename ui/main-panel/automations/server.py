"""
Automations Dashboard — read-only aggregation endpoint.

Unifies four disconnected sources into one view per agent:
  • agent_automations        — scheduled cron tasks
  • agent_event_subscriptions — push/poll event triggers
  • agent_spawns             — active worker spawns (orchestrator helpers)
  • webhook_registrations    — user-level generic inbound webhooks (separate section)

No destructive actions. Follows the same auth pattern as list_event_subscriptions.
Drop-in file — not wired into any core registry.
