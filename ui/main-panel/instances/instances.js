// Instances — drop-in Admin Tools view module.
//
// A grid of every WebAgent INSTANCE signed in to the shared database PLUS every
// cloud VM in a connected cloud account, styled after the main Agents page
// (ui/main-panel/agents/): each instance is a square tile; clicking one expands a
// tabbed detail region below it (the "Overview" tab). THIS device is always
// present (the backend inserts a self row even before its first heartbeat) and
// marked "This device".
//
// This page is the SINGLE HOME that absorbed two now-deleted admin pages plus the
// old Data Settings → Deployment section:
//   • the old "Database & Devices" page — its "This device" connection config
//     (database sign-in, secrets-vault sign-in, the silent-fallback warning) now
//     lives in a "Connections" section INSIDE the "This device" tile's Overview
//     (open the tile to reach it). The linked-devices list it showed is the tile
//     grid here.
//   • the old "Server Manager" page — its cloud VMs now appear as tiles in the
//     grid, with Start / Stop / Delete / Open / Ping in the open card's header
//     + a live log in each cloud tile's Overview; its cloud-ACCOUNT manager
//     (add a provider, paste its key)
//     also lives in the "This device" Overview's Connections section. Its manual
//     "machines" and "sites" (hand-typed boxes/URLs) and the shared-vs-local
//     explainer were intentionally dropped — this page is about auto-discovered
//     instances + cloud infrastructure you actually control, not a manual asset
//     inventory.
//   • Data Settings → Deployment's "local deployments" list split in two here:
//     (a) this app's Server reset + port editor → a "Server" section INSIDE the
//     "This device" Overview (_serverSectionHtml, self tile only), since those act
//     on the running app you're on; (b) any sibling WebAgent checkouts on this
//     machine → their own first-class grid TILES (kind:'local', _normalizeLocal /
//     _localTiles), with Start / Stop / Delete / Open in the card header +
//     inline edit in each tile's Overview (_renderLocalOverview) — managed just
//     like cloud VMs, and CREATED
//     from the New instance tile → New Deployment → "This device". Backed by the
//     same /admin/deploy/instances/* + /admin/storage/server/restart endpoints
//     (app/local_instances.py) the old section used — only the UI home moved;
//     deploy.js's own list/restart code is now orphaned (see its header). So the
//     whole deployment surface now sits with the fleet.
//
// Backed by this folder's OWN router — ui/main-panel/instances/server.py
// (mounted via page.json `router`), which consolidates everything the two old
// pages' backends did under one prefix:
//   GET  /admin/instances/devices           the presence registry (fleet tiles)
//   POST /admin/instances/device/rename      set a device's custom name / icon (shared DB)
//   POST /admin/instances/device/unlink      drop a stale (offline) device's row
//   GET  /admin/instances/backend-status     DB + vault health / shared-ness
//   GET  /admin/instances/providers          manageable cloud providers
//   GET  /admin/instances/cloud-instances    VMs in one cloud account (+repo overlay)
//   POST /admin/instances/connect|disconnect cloud-account sign-in / removal
//   POST /admin/instances/instance/action    start/stop/delete a VM (NDJSON stream)
//   POST /admin/instances/annotate|ping      set a VM's repo / reachability check
// The DB + vault CONNECT/TEST/ACTIVATE controls still call the shared, app-wide
// /admin/storage/* endpoints (never re-implemented here).
//
// INSTANT FIRST PAINT — the "New instance" create tile and the "This device" tile
// show immediately, with no network wait (last-known fleet cache, else a synthetic
// self tile from the browser), and This device's Overview is OPEN by default (a
// saved selection for another device/cloud/New tile overrides — see startView +
// _setActive). Everything after that is PARTIAL LOADING: the fleet batch, cloud
// accounts (per-account), connection health and local checkouts all fire at once
// (the PREWARM pass) and each source PAINTS the moment it settles, so cards open
// in order instead of one big batch behind a spinner. Cards whose source hasn't
// landed yet — a slow cloud account — wait as a labelled pending skeleton at the
// END of the grid and jump into their ordered slot when the data arrives ("fall
// back to being last"). Per-device PREWARM config: the ORDER is the grid
// arrangement — device/cloud tiles are drag-reorderable, top-left first,
// bottom-right last (see _wireTileDrag) — and a QUALIFIER (auto/always/never) is
// editable in each tile's Overview; both persist in the shared DB (see
// _prewarmSectionHtml). The 20s poll refreshes presence silently. To keep this off
// the first-paint path the heavy New-Deployment machinery (deploy.js/dns.js) is
// NOT imported at load — it's lazily dynamic-imported only when the New instance
// tile is first opened (see _mountNewDeploy).
//
// Discovered via ui/main-panel/instances/page.json and driven generically by the
// admin shell (ui/shared/js/files.js applySidebarView). PANEL-LESS view.
// Styling: instances.css — self-contained (the tile grid + the in-Overview
// Connections section; the smb-/cvm- card/form primitives were folded in when the
// two old pages were removed). All colours come from the design-system palette (CSS variables only)
// — correct in dark + light.
// REMOVE-WHEN: the Instances view is dropped from the admin page catalog.
