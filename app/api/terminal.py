# Each browser-side terminal tab passes a client-generated session_id when it
# opens the WebSocket. A PTY is spawned on first connect for that id and kept
# alive across WS reconnects (refresh / network blip), so a long-running
# command keeps going even if the user closes their tab and comes back later.
# Sessions are reaped when:
#   • the shell exits naturally (e.g. user types `exit`) — caught lazily on
#     the next lookup that touches that id, or proactively on each new
#     session creation,
#   • the browser explicitly DELETEs the session (close-tab path),
#   • the idle GC pass kills shells whose WS has been detached longer than
#     `IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` (prevents slow fd creep on long-running VMs), or
#   • the server shuts down.

# Appended to every tmux session we create/attach so the browser's scroll
# wheel works as a human expects inside a TUI like Claude Code.
#
# Why this is needed: a mouse-aware TUI (Claude) run DIRECTLY turns on mouse
# reporting, so xterm.js forwards the wheel to it and it scrolls its OWN message
# history. tmux defaults to mouse OFF, so when Claude runs *inside* tmux the
# browser sees the alternate screen with no mouse reporting and falls back to
# translating the wheel into cursor-up/down keys — which tmux delivers to the
# focused pane, where they scroll Claude's prompt-history instead of the
# messages. Turning tmux's mouse mode on makes tmux forward the wheel to the
# mouse-aware app in the pane, restoring the direct-run behaviour. `-g` is
# server-global and re-setting it is a no-op, so this is safe to append to
# every launch/attach command.
#
# We use `';'` to separate the tmux subcommands (instead of `\;` which was
# previously used). The single quotes work on both bash/WSL and PowerShell:
# both treat `';'` as a literal semicolon passed as an argument to tmux,
# which tmux interprets as its command separator. PowerShell's `\;` is NOT
# an escape — `;` would act as a PowerShell statement separator, splitting
# the command and causing the "A parameter cannot be found that matches
# parameter name 'g'" error from Set-Variable.

# not at config time — the newest Claude Code conversation that ISN'T currently
# open in a running `claude`, and returns the shell command that resumes it in a
# fresh terminal tab.
#
#   • "Newest anywhere": all conversations across every project folder are
#     ranked by last-touched time. Each conversation's own working directory is
#     read out of its transcript, so the new tab lands in the right folder
#     before resuming.
#   • "Already open": a conversation counts as open if either signal fires:
#       1. A live web-terminal tab opened by THIS button is running it (recorded
#          on the TerminalSession from the WS's ?claude_session=<id> param).
#          Cross-platform — this is what makes a second click skip the one you
#          just opened on Windows, where /proc doesn't exist. It self-clears:
#          close the tab and the conversation is resumable again.
#       2. Any live process is holding its transcript file open OR a
#          `claude --resume <id>` command line carries its id. This reads /proc,
#          so it also catches conversations opened by hand outside webAgent — but
#          only on Linux/Termux (the phone). On hosts without /proc this second
#          signal is empty and only signal 1 applies.
#   • Fallbacks: if there are no conversations, or every recent one is already
#     open, it returns a plain `claude` (a fresh conversation) instead.

# The web terminal is a text-only pipe: the browser, the WebSocket and the
# shell only ever exchange keystrokes/bytes, so an image copied to the BROWSER
# clipboard can't be "typed" in the way text can. Claude Code's own Ctrl+V
# image paste is no help here either — it reads the OS clipboard of the machine
# where `claude` runs (the SERVER), not the browser's clipboard, so it finds
# nothing when the user is on a phone/laptop over the tunnel.
#
# This endpoint bridges the gap via Claude Code's other supported image route —
# "a file path in your message". The browser POSTs the pasted (or dropped)
# image bytes here; we save them to a real file on the server's disk and hand
# back its absolute path. The frontend then types that path into the terminal,
# and Claude Code (or any program that accepts an image path) reads it. Nothing
# depends on a shared clipboard, so it works remotely.
