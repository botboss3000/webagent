"""
Browser CONNECTOR WebSocket — the server end of the browser-extension link.

A thin route over the engine in app/tools/browser_connector.py, exactly as
app/api/browser_stream.py is a thin route over app/tools/browser.py. A user
installs the webAgent browser extension; it opens ONE authenticated WebSocket
here and waits for ``{type:"cmd"}`` frames, runs each command in the user's real
browser, and replies ``{type:"result"}``. The agent's ``browser_action``
forwards to this link whenever a session's backend is "connector" (see the
connector branch in app/tools/browser.py).

Auth mirrors the browser WS in browser_stream.py: a JWT in ``?token=`` (the
extension can't set headers on the WebSocket handshake from the background page),
with the open-mode tokenless fallback so a single-user / local box works without
minting a JWT. A command is only ever routed to the authenticated owner's own
connection, so the socket carries no cross-tenant risk.

    bridge: the user is already signed in to the app (so request_user_id resolves
    them here), and we hand back a JWT scoped to that same user with a long
