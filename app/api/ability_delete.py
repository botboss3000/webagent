Ability Delete API — delete an ability file (or a whole group) from plugins/abilities/.

By default abilities are deletable through the UI. An ability is only blocked if
its descriptor carries ``"protected": true`` — those must be removed/edited or
deleted from disk manually. Whole groups can also be deleted (entire folder),
unless any member ability is protected.
