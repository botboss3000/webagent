"""Device presence API — lists the WebAgent instances ("devices") that share
this database, for the target-device picker used by the chat pill, the
automations "Run on" field, and the sessions device badge.

Read-only. Actual cross-device dispatch happens elsewhere (the agent tools in
plugins/abilities/Devices/, the automation runner's firing seam, and the chat
send path) — this endpoint only answers "which devices exist and which are
online right now?". See app/devices/ for the engine.
