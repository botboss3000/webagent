"""
KMS-wrapped encryption — placeholder.

Same as FieldFernet but the KEK is held in a cloud KMS (GCP KMS or AWS KMS).
The KEK never leaves the KMS; DEK wrap/unwrap calls hit the KMS Encrypt /
Decrypt APIs and DEKs are cached in-process with a short TTL.

For now this class refuses construction with a clear message so the UI can
expose the option without claiming functionality that isn't wired yet.
Building it out is a follow-up: implement GCPKMSKey / AWSKMSKey key sources
and inject them into VaultKeyManager in place of the local KEK.
