"""
SQLCipher full-DB encryption — placeholder.

SQLCipher encrypts the entire SQLite database file under a single passphrase.
It is **not** tenant-isolated (all rows share the passphrase), so it is best
used as a defense-in-depth layer beneath field-level encryption.

Activation requires the optional `pysqlcipher3` dependency:

    pip install pysqlcipher3

When level == "full_db" the StorageBackend factory should branch on import
and instantiate a SQLCipher-aware LocalBackend. That branch is not yet
implemented — this module exists so the factory can refuse the level cleanly
with a clear message and so the UI can offer the option.
