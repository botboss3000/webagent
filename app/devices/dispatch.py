"""Cross-device dispatch — enqueue a job for another device, and nudge it awake.

``enqueue()`` writes a pending row into the shared ``device_jobs`` queue. The
targeted device's worker (app/devices/worker.py) claims and runs it with ITS OWN
local tools. ``nudge()`` is the "knock" so the target acts within seconds instead
of waiting for its next poll:

  • Target is THIS instance (or a broadcast job): kick the local worker now.
  • Target is another instance: the target's short poll picks the job up shortly
    (the responsiveness floor). A direct push to a known endpoint is a documented
    future upgrade — see ``nudge`` — but is never required for correctness.
