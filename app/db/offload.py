"""Run a blocking (synchronous-under-async) DB call OFF the main event loop.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The DB backends (SQLite / psycopg-Postgres) are *synchronous*. Their methods are
declared ``async def`` for a uniform interface, but the body runs the network
round-trip inline — so ``await db.method()`` executes the round-trip ON the event
loop and FREEZES every other coroutine for its full duration. On a *local* DB a
round-trip is sub-millisecond (invisible). On a *remote* DB each round-trip is
~150ms+, and because the chat LLM stream is an ``AsyncOpenAI`` HTTP call driven by
the SAME loop, every concurrent DB call (background pollers, per-turn writes,
streaming bookkeeping, memory saves) freezes the loop and stalls the model's
token stream. Measured: a no-tool reply spent 55s in send-prep and 37s in memory
recall — almost entirely loop STARVATION by serialized 150ms round-trips, not the
model.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
``db_offload(factory)`` hands the DB coroutine to a small, PERSISTENT pool of
worker threads (the "DB workers"). ``await``-ing it SUSPENDS the calling coroutine
and lets the main loop keep running other tasks — including the LLM stream — while
a worker thread waits on the network (psycopg/sqlite release the GIL on I/O).
Control flow and ordering are unchanged: a drop-in for ``await db.method()`` that
simply stops freezing the loop.

    # before:  await db.run_state_set_op(session_id, op)
    # after:   await db_offload(lambda: db.run_state_set_op(session_id, op))

WHY A PERSISTENT POOL (and not ``asyncio.to_thread`` + ``asyncio.run``)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first version did ``asyncio.to_thread(lambda: asyncio.run(factory()))``. That
worked but paid two avoidable costs on the chat hot path, where ``db_offload`` is
called many times per turn:

  * ``asyncio.run`` builds and tears down a BRAND-NEW event loop on EVERY call —
    pure overhead repeated dozens of times a turn.
  * ``asyncio.to_thread`` uses the default executor, a pool shared with every
    other ``to_thread`` caller in the process; under a burst of concurrent
    offloads (the per-turn read fan-out) calls queue behind unrelated work.

This module instead owns a DEDICATED, fixed-size pool of worker threads, each
holding ONE long-lived event loop that is reused for every call it runs. So a
``db_offload`` is just "submit the coroutine to an already-running worker" — no
loop spin-up, no contention with unrelated ``to_thread`` work. The pool is
fixed-size (bounded parallelism) and sized to sit UNDER the Postgres connection
pool cap, so workers never out-number available DB connections.

A fixed pool of N threads still gives REAL parallelism for the per-turn read
fan-out (N independent round-trips in flight at once), exactly as before — it just
stops re-creating the machinery every call.

WHY DRIVING WRITES ON A WORKER LOOP IS SAFE
-------------------------------------------
An earlier offload attempt broke chat: the backends guarded writes with an
``asyncio.Lock`` bound to the MAIN loop, so a write coroutine driven by a worker
thread's loop threw "is bound to a different event loop" and the turn died
(message stuck "pending"). That lock is now ``_DbWriteLock`` (a thread-safe
``threading.Semaphore`` — see app/db/local.py), which is loop- and thread-agnostic,
so the only remaining rule is the one below.

HARD RULE
---------
Only offload **pure-DB** coroutines. NEVER offload a method that awaits a
main-loop-bound async client — the embedding client (app/agent/embed.py), or the
WebSocket broadcaster ``notify_user`` reached via ``_emit_agent_run_status``
(so ``run_state_begin`` / ``run_state_finish`` and the memory embed/vector methods
stay on the main loop). Driving those on a worker loop corrupts the shared client.

NOTES
-----
* ``factory`` is a zero-arg callable returning a FRESH coroutine (use a lambda).
* The per-turn read cache is a ``ContextVar``. ``asyncio.to_thread`` copied the
  context for free; ``run_in_executor`` does NOT, so we copy it explicitly
  (``contextvars.copy_context()``) and run the coroutine inside that copy. The
  copy shares the SAME cache dict object, so fills made on a worker thread are
  still visible to the main turn — caching keeps working exactly as before.
