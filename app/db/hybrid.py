"""Hybrid local-first storage backend (SQLite hot store + Postgres authority).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
A decorator over TWO ``StorageBackend``-shaped objects — a LOCAL SQLite backend
and a REMOTE Postgres backend — that presents the single ``StorageBackend``
surface the rest of the app already calls. It is inserted in ``get_db()`` exactly
the way :class:`EncryptedStorageBackend` wraps a single backend today. Nothing
above the storage layer (agent loop, API, UI) changes.

Like ``EncryptedStorageBackend`` it deliberately does NOT inherit from the
``StorageBackend`` ABC (that would force us to re-declare ~100 abstract methods).
It duck-types: any method NOT explicitly overridden here is delegated by
``__getattr__`` to a default backend, so callers typed as ``StorageBackend`` are
unaffected.

DISPOSITIONS (see temp/hybrid-local-first-db-handoff.md §3)
----------------------------------------------------------
Every method resolves to one of four behaviours:

  * SERVER-AUTHORITATIVE (money / identity / coordination) → remote, synchronous.
    A local copy must NEVER decide authorization/billing. This is the default for
    anything not explicitly localized, so the app stays correct-by-default.
  * SYNCED (shared content/config)  → local read (fast) + local write-through, with
    the write enqueued to an outbox and pushed to remote in the background.
  * PRE-CACHED LOCAL (chat-start config) → same as Synced, warm local replica.
  * LOCAL-ONLY / LOCAL-HEAVY (disposable detail) → local only, never remote.

PHASING
-------
This file is built up phase by phase; each phase is independently shippable and
guarded so the live app is untouched until the hybrid is explicitly enabled.

  * Phase 1 (this commit): the seam. Everything delegates to REMOTE (the
    authority) — i.e. exactly today's behaviour when Postgres is the active DB —
    while a live LOCAL backend is constructed and held, ready for later phases.
    Zero behaviour change; proves the wrapper composes with encryption + the
    factory.
  * Phase 2: local-only tier (diagnostics / render recordings never hit remote).
  * Phase 3: the ``interactions`` split (fat tool payloads local, skeleton synced).
  * Phase 4: write-through + outbox sync for the rest of the Synced tier.

ENABLEMENT
----------
On by default. Turned off via ``app/db_hybrid.json`` (``{"enabled": false}``) or the
``WEBAGENT_DB_HYBRID`` env var when config is env-locked. Only ever built when a
reachable Postgres-family remote exists — on a local-only install it is a no-op
and ``get_db()`` returns the plain local backend as before.

    # chat-open and on every turn, but unlike the append-only transcript it is
    # CENTRALLY AUTHORED and can change. So we keep a warm LOCAL replica and, on a
