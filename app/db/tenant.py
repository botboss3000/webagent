"""
Per-user data-backend resolver (multi-tenant / bring-your-own-database).

Given a user id, returns the StorageBackend that holds THAT user's interaction
data (their own Postgres). This is the "data plane" half of the split; the
control plane (accounts, agent catalog, billing) stays on the central backend
returned by `app.db.get_control_db()`.

Only used when App Settings → Multi-tenant data is ON. The tenant router
(app/db/router.py) calls `resolve_data_backend()` with the current caller's id.

Design notes
------------
* Each personal Postgres backend owns its own psycopg connection pool
  (min 4 / max 16). We therefore keep a small LRU of warm tenant backends and
  close a pool when its tenant is evicted (idle TTL or over the cap) so a busy
  server can't accumulate unbounded connections.
* Tenant backends are wrapped with the field-level encryption shim
  (`_maybe_wrap_encryption`) so a user's own LLM keys / vault (auth_elements) are
  encrypted at rest in their DB — but NOT with the hybrid local-first wrapper:
  hybrid uses one shared local SQLite hot store, which would cross-contaminate
  tenants. Personal DBs go straight to Postgres.
* No-personal-DB fallback: when multi-tenant is ON but a user has no registry
  record, we fall back to the central control backend (a shared "trial" DB) and
  flag it so the UI can show a "connect your own database" banner. A user who DOES
  have a personal DB that is currently unreachable is NOT silently sent to central
  (that would split their transcript across two databases) — we raise instead, and
  their chat surfaces a clear "your database is unreachable" error.
