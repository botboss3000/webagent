"""The sync engine — pusher (local outbox → remote) + puller (remote → local).

Scope: the SYNCED tier only (shared content/config). Money and coordination are
written straight to Postgres by the hybrid backend and never appear here. Conflict
policy is last-writer-wins on the table's ``updated_at`` watermark, which is
acceptable for config-like rows that are edited rarely and from one active device
at a time (handoff §8).

This engine is deliberately backend-agnostic: it moves rows through the portable
raw-client query builder (``select/in_/gt/order/upsert``), so it works whether the
remote is real Postgres or (in tests) a second SQLite file.

STATUS: the mechanics are exercised by temp/test_hybrid.py against a two-SQLite
harness. Wiring ``start()`` into the app lifespan and flipping the hybrid's Synced
writes to local-first+enqueue is the ACTIVATION step — it needs a real Postgres
remote to validate end-to-end and is intentionally left off by default.

    columns whose value is stripped to NULL on the remote skeleton when it exceeds
    ``strip_over`` chars (the full copy stays in the local hot store); a small
    value at/under the gate rides along inline. ``push_only`` marks a table the
    engine only pushes local→remote and never pulls back (used for the

# The Synced tier (handoff §6). Extend as more tables are moved local-first; each
# addition is data, not new control flow.
#
# ``interactions`` is the transcript (Stage 2): written local-first + pushed as a
# SKELETON — oversized *tool-result content* is stripped to NULL on the remote
# (the full copy stays local). User and assistant text stays present for a useful
# cross-device handoff. It is push-only: the remote has no
# per-row ``updated_at`` to watermark on, and a second device gets the transcript
# through the hybrid's warm-on-open mirror instead of the puller.
#
# REMOTE-CONTROL CONTINUITY: ``output`` is now slimmed to a SKELETON (tool names
# + IDs only, flagged ``_remote_placeholder: true``) instead of full fat-strip.
# The skeleton preserves enough for the remote UI to show "N tool calls" headings,
# and the takeover history rebuild (session_history.py) detects the flag and
# skips the tool_calls + orphaned tool result rows gracefully. The full output
# (args, results, LLM output) stays in the local hot store. Tool results carry
# nearly all transcript bulk and are not needed to continue a handed-off chat;
# retaining their tool name/id while replacing a large body with a clear marker
# preserves both monitoring and history pairing. Pushing them in full also stalls
# the sync worker and, when a row carries a stray NUL, wedges the queue in a
# permanent retry.
