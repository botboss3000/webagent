"""Seed content for the default `home` page rendered into a new user's
Dashboard iframe on first visit.

The actual template lives next to this file as `home.html` — a plain
self-contained HTML document so it can be opened in a browser, edited
with HTML tooling, and reviewed without Python-string escape gymnastics.
We read it once at module load.

Theme: dark by default. Parent posts {type:'theme', value:'light'|'dark'}
via window.postMessage and the page toggles `<html class="light">` to
swap palettes. Falls back to `prefers-color-scheme` when opened
standalone."""
