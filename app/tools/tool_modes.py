"""
Per-agent tool exposure modes — the single source of truth for *how* a tool is
presented to the model each turn.

Background
----------
Every tool the agent is allowed to use (after ability gating) is loaded into the
tool set. But not every tool's full JSON schema needs to be sent to the model on
every turn — that costs context tokens and, historically, encouraged the model
to "discover" tools it didn't have. Instead each tool has a **mode**:

  - ``core``         — fundamental, always sent, NOT toggleable. The discovery /
                       activation tools live here (without ``load_tool`` the
                       model could never reach anything else).
  - ``always``       — full schema sent every turn. This is the default for any
                       tool with no explicit per-agent setting, so existing
                       agents behave exactly as before.
  - ``discoverable`` — only the name + one-line description appear in the
                       generated ``# [TOOLS]`` index. The full schema is withheld
                       until the model calls ``load_tool("<name>")``, which marks
                       it active for the rest of the session.

The per-agent overrides live in ``agents.metadata`` under ``tool_modes`` —
a flat ``{tool_name: "always" | "discoverable"}`` map. The session's
``active_tools`` list (in ``sessions.metadata``) records which discoverable
tools the model has loaded so far. Both are written by dedicated DB methods.

This module is intentionally dependency-light: it imports the built-in tool
metadata lazily so it can be used from the loop, the loader, and the API layer
without creating import cycles.
