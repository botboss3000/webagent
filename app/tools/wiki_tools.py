"""Wiki-control tools — let an agent manage the company-wide Wiki.

The Wiki is one shared, searchable knowledge base (company info, policies,
contacts, any reference data). These tools wrap the same store the HTTP API and
the UI use (``app/wiki/store.py``), so an article an agent writes shows up
immediately in the Wiki tab and in everyone's search.

  wiki_search       — semantic + keyword search across visible articles
  wiki_list         — list visible articles (titles/tags/snippets)
  wiki_get          — read one full article by slug
  wiki_create       — add a new article (defaults to draft/internal)
  wiki_update       — edit an existing article
  wiki_set_status   — publish (make public) or unpublish (make internal)
  wiki_delete       — remove an article
  wiki_history      — list an article's prior versions (revision history)
  wiki_get_revision — read the full text of one past revision
  wiki_restore      — roll an article back to a past revision
  wiki_backlinks    — find which articles link to a given one

Article bodies are **Markdown** — write headings, lists, bold, tables, links.
Link to another wiki article with double brackets: ``[[Article Title]]`` (or
``[[slug]]``). Those become live links in the UI and feed the backlinks graph.

**Visibility (draft vs published).** Every article is either ``draft`` (internal —
only signed-in members can see it) or ``published`` (public — visible to everyone,
including anonymous visitors). New articles start as **draft**; call
``wiki_set_status`` to publish when it's ready to share. The tools honour who you
are acting for: when serving a **signed-in member** you can read & search drafts
AND published; when serving an **anonymous visitor** you can only see published
articles, and editing is refused. So never put confidential content in a
published article, and don't publish something unless it's meant for the public.

Gated by the ``wiki_control`` ability (off by default — writes/deletes change
data everyone sees). Injected by app/tools/loader.py only when that ability is on.
