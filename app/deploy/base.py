"""The deploy-target contract.

A deploy target (Google VM, AWS, a plain Linux box, Docker) is a DROP-IN: one
file under ``app/deploy/providers/`` exposing a module-level ``PROVIDER`` (an
instance of a ``BaseDeployProvider`` subclass) plus a ``FEATURE`` header. The
registry (``app/deploy/registry.py``) auto-discovers it — no central edit. This
mirrors how scheduler providers and remote-access methods already work.

Each target declares two field lists that drive the panel's forms:

  * ``config_fields``     — NON-secret settings (project, region, machine size,
                            repo URL, domain). Stored in ``data/config/deploy.json``.
  * ``credential_fields`` — the cloud keys. Secrets land in the encrypted vault
                            (``app/deploy/credentials.py``); blank-on-save keeps
                            the stored value; auto-discarded after a successful
                            deploy when the panel's "forget keys" option is on.

A field is ``{key, label, type, secret?, required?, placeholder?, options?,
default?, hint?}`` where ``type`` is one of ``text`` / ``password`` /
``textarea`` / ``select`` / ``checkbox`` / ``number``.

Three actions, all admin-gated by the router:

  * ``test(config, creds)``           — verify the keys work, create nothing.
  * ``deploy(config, creds, emit)``   — async generator streaming progress
                                        events; the FINAL event is
                                        ``{"phase": "done", "result": {...}}``
                                        carrying ``{ok, public_url, server, …}``.
  * ``destroy(config, creds, record)``— async generator; tear the server down.

Progress events are ``{"phase", "message", "level"}`` (level ∈ info/ok/warn/err),
the same vocabulary the Commit ⭐ stream uses, so the frontend reader is shared
in spirit.
