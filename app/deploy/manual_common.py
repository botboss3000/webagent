"""Shared helpers for MANUAL deploy targets (Windows, macOS, …).

A "manual" deploy target installs WebAgent onto a device the admin already owns by
handing back a single copy-paste command — no cloud account, nothing billable
(see ``app/deploy/base.BaseDeployProvider.manual``). Every such target needs the
SAME pre-command logic before its platform-specific shell line: tidy the repo URL
the admin typed, and — for a private repo — splice an access token into the clone
URL so the device can fetch it. That logic lives here so each platform provider
(``app/deploy/providers/windows.py``, ``app/deploy/providers/macos.py``) only has
to describe its own one-liner.

The Linux/Termux target (``app/deploy/providers/termux.py``) predates this module
and keeps its own copy of the same helpers; the browser mirrors all of them in
``ui/admin-tools/app-config/app-settings/deploy.js`` so the command box renders
LIVE even before the server is restarted.
