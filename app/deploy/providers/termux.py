"""Deploy target: a Linux computer, or an Android phone/tablet via Termux.

Unlike the cloud targets, there is no machine to CREATE here — the "server" is a
device the admin already owns (a Linux box, or an Android device running the free
Termux app), which is normally NOT reachable from this server. So this target
never connects anywhere: clicking *Deploy* GENERATES one copy-paste command the
admin runs once in a terminal (or in Termux).

Termux is essentially a small Linux userland on Android, so ONE command works in
both places — it detects which it is on. The only Termux-specific "customization"
is that a phone can't reliably build WebAgent's heavy native dependencies
(sqlcipher, compiled wheels), so on Termux the command installs everything inside
an Ubuntu ``proot-distro`` sandbox; on a plain Linux box it installs straight onto
the system. Both paths live in the repo's ``deploy/termux-setup.sh``, which builds
the venv + installs the Playwright-free dependency set (``req_no_playwright.txt``)
and keeps the server alive in the background with auto-restart (plus a wake-lock on
a phone, via ``start_server_termux.sh``).

This is a "manual" target (``manual = True``): no cloud key, nothing billable,
nothing to tear down remotely. The flag tells the Deploy panel to drop the
cloud-key section + the billable-resource confirm dialog, and to render the
generated command in a copy-to-clipboard box instead of a "last server" line.
