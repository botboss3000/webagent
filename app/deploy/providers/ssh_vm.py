"""Deploy target: an EXISTING Linux VM you already own, reached over SSH.

The cloud targets (``google_vm``) CREATE a machine and hand it the shared install
recipe as a boot ``startup-script``. This target creates nothing: the admin
already has a running Ubuntu/Debian server (a VM at some IP, a rented box, a
Raspberry Pi on the LAN) and just wants WebAgent installed onto it. So instead of
a cloud API, it opens an SSH connection, uploads the SAME bootstrap
(``app/deploy/bootstrap.py``) the cloud targets use, runs it under root, and
streams the install log back into the panel live — the machine ends up with the
identical Caddy + systemd + uvicorn stack a fresh cloud VM would get.

Because it acts on a machine the admin already owns (nothing billable is created
and nothing is deleted on tear-down), it sets ``creates_server = False`` — the
panel then softens its Deploy / Tear-down confirmations accordingly. It is NOT a
"manual" target: it really connects and does the work with a live log, rather
than printing a copy-paste command.

Auth is EITHER an SSH private key (optionally passphrase-protected) OR a
password — whichever the admin provides. Root is used directly; a non-root user
escalates with ``sudo`` (the password is fed to ``sudo -S`` over the channel, so
it never appears in the process list). All three secrets live in the encrypted
vault like every other deploy key; by default they are KEPT after a deploy (not
auto-forgotten) so a later tear-down / re-install can reconnect.

Needs the optional ``paramiko`` SSH library. If it isn't installed, ``available``
reports that clearly and the other targets are unaffected (the exact case the
base contract's ``available`` hook exists for).
