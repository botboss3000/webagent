"""Deploy target: Google Compute Engine VM (the Phase-1 reference target).

Creates a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM, hands it the shared install recipe
(``app/deploy/bootstrap.py``) as the instance ``startup-script``, opens the
firewall for HTTP/HTTPS, and reports the public address. This is exactly how the
app already runs in production, so the steps are known-good.

No extra Python dependency: it drives the Compute Engine REST API directly with
``httpx``, authenticating with the admin's service-account JSON via the same
JWT-bearer token exchange the Google Cloud Scheduler provider uses (RFC 7523 →
an OAuth access token). ``cryptography`` (already a dependency) signs the JWT.
