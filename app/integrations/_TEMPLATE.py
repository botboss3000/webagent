"""TEMPLATE — copy me to add a new integration. DO NOT edit the core to add one.

================================================================================
 webAgent structure philosophy:  CORE app  vs.  DROP-IN plugins
================================================================================
A new capability is **a new file in a plugin folder**, never an edit to the core.
The app *discovers* plugin files at runtime — you register nothing by hand.

  • This folder (app/integrations/)  → OAuth / API integrations (this template)
  • app/events/sources/              → "when X happens" event sources
  • app/communications/plugins/      → message channels (telegram, slack, …)
  • app/connectors/                  → per-agent external data sources
  • app/secrets/                     → secrets vaults
  • app/encryption/                  → encryption methods
  • app/billing/processors/          → payment processors
  • app/scheduler/providers/         → remote scheduler backends

To add an integration:
  1. Copy this file to app/integrations/<your_capability>_tools.py
  2. Fill in the FEATURE header and the TOOLS list below.
  3. That's it — it's auto-discovered. Do NOT add it to app/tools/loader.py,
     app/tools/core_tools.py, app/main.py, or any central registry / if-elif.

To REMOVE a capability: delete its file. Nothing else references it.

Every plugin declares a FEATURE header so the feature catalog + editions know
about it (App Config → Features; docs/claude/production-editions.md). `status`
is the production gate: stable / beta / experimental. A file with no FEATURE is
treated as `unknown` and excluded from non-`full` editions — so always add one.
