"""Deterministic seeding of the JSON config *library* from in-code defaults.

The app boots fine with `data/config/` absent — every reader falls back to a
built-in default and the writers create the folder lazily (see
:mod:`app.util.config_io` and :mod:`app.util.paths`). This module is the
**inverse, opt-in** action: an admin who wants a populated, editable
`data/config/` to work from can have the app **write out the whole library** of
config files from the canonical defaults each owning module already defines.

Design (decided with the user):
  * **The app generates them deterministically** from in-code templates — never a
    live LLM (which would need a provider config that may itself be missing).
  * **Admin-triggered + preview-first** — :func:`plan` shows what a run would do;
    :func:`seed_missing` performs it. Wired to an Admin Tools button.
  * **Never overwrites** — an existing file is skipped, never clobbered, so a run
    is always safe to repeat (it only fills gaps).

Where each default lives: in its OWNING module (the "instructions in code"), so
the default and the code that reads it can't drift. This registry only COLLECTS
them. Files that manage their own lifecycle — self-bootstrapping, secret-bearing,
or network-fetched — are listed as *auto-managed*: shown in the plan for a
complete picture, but never machine-written here.
