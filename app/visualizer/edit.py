"""
edit_canvas — surgical edits to a saved canvas, WITHOUT re-rendering the whole page.

``render_visual`` always replaces the entire document: every fix means re-emitting
the full ~30KB page, which is slow, risks truncation, and lets old bugs ride along
into each rewrite. ``edit_canvas`` is the alternative for *changing* an existing
canvas: read it (``get_canvas``), then apply one or more exact find/replace edits to
just the parts that change. It routes through the SAME ``save_canvas_html`` path as
``render_visual`` (so the manifest + the live Canvas refresh behave identically) and
returns the same ``path``/``slug``/``title`` shape the frontend reload handler reads.

Design choices that keep it safe:
  • Edits are applied to an in-memory copy and only saved if EVERY edit succeeds —
    a miss leaves the canvas untouched (atomic), never half-edited.
  • Each ``find`` must match the current text and be unique (unless ``replace_all``),
    mirroring a normal code-edit tool — so an ambiguous match can't silently hit the
    wrong spot.
  • The result is re-checked for a complete ``</html>`` document before saving, so a
    bad edit can't leave a truncated page.

Lives in the Visualizer ability (registered alongside render_visual/get_canvas); no
core file is touched. Same trust boundary as the rest of the canvas tools: access
follows the Canvas page's VISIBILITY setting, enforced server-side (registration
required by default; admins + open single-user mode always pass — see app/auth
`canvas_first_class` → user_may_access_page, and screenshot_canvas).
