"""
Output Closer — parallel close-out loop.

When an agent's FINAL response is sent to the user — or the run is interrupted
or errors out — this app function first checks whether that response is already
a suitable close-out. A lone response, lightweight conversation, or an explicit
result/summary is reused verbatim. Otherwise a bounded background LLM call reads
the conversation since the last Closer lane (the user's starting message, the
agent's working messages, and any interruption message; never tool calls, never
raw tool output) and REWORDS it into ONE concise, polished message. It renders
in the chat as its own separate 'Closer' lane bubble right after the agent's
normal response (which stays untouched above it).

The summary is persisted as a ``role='system'`` interaction row
(``source='system:closer'``) and pushed to the chat UI as an ``summary``
event. The UI renders it as a separate bubble labeled 'Closer'; it survives
refresh / session-switch (the reconcile poll picks it up from the DB).

Design mirrors the Task Grouping feature (``app/admin/tasks.py``):

- **Prompt** — ``app/defaults/app-prompts.json`` → ``app_level_prompts.output_closer``
  (or the ``data/config`` override), with a built-in fallback so the loop never
  breaks on a config error.
- **On/off** — the Output Closer app function (App Settings ▸ App
  Functions), gated live via ``app_function_enabled("output_closer")`` so
  the toggle takes effect immediately.
- **Model** — the roster's STANDARD role model (the same model ordinary chat
  replies run on: the first enabled text-capable entry, or the pinned default),
  resolved from the DB provider config. Env vars are NOT consulted.

Robust and fully parallel: the loop fires an ``asyncio`` task right after the
final ``response`` event is yielded (see the call sites in ``app/agent/loop.py``),
so it never delays, blocks, or breaks the main response. The summary is
DURABLE, not best-effort: the LLM call retries transient errors and blank
completions (``_LLM_ATTEMPTS``), the DB insert retries SQLite writer-slot
contention (``_WRITE_ATTEMPTS``), and a leader-registered recovery sweep
(``start_sweep`` / ``stop_sweep`` — the watchdog-analog, gated on the same app
function) re-fires the close-out for any final response that never got one —
covering a server crash between the ``response`` event and the insert, an LLM
outage, or a hook that never ran. Failures are stamped onto the final
assistant row (``summary_attempt_at`` / ``summary_attempts``) so the sweep
backs off instead of hammering a broken provider.

    "- Budget your bullets per section: up to 12 line items for a main topic, up to 6 for a subtopic. One line per item; cut filler and merge duplicates; if more than 12 things could be said, keep the most important. The budget is per section, so a large run may cover several topics without any one becoming an essay.\n"

This audit report sits outside the 12/6 bullet budget: give it the space it needs, and keep the rest of the message tight.

# first-person voice ("I'm not done yet — I still need to…"), so the transcript
# reads as the agent telling itself to keep working (no faux user message). The
# agent re-runs (supervised, inheriting the session's execution mode) to finish

    uses the default clean transcript — the user's messages and the agent's

    to the closer: its job is to summarize the outputs and check the agent's
    responses for gaps against the criteria, not to re-verify tool internals.
