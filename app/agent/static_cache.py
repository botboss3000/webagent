"""Cross-message in-process cache for per-agent STATIC data.

Some hot-path work is re-derived from the database on EVERY message even though
its inputs don't change between messages in a conversation — most expensively the
agent's tool set (``load_tools`` makes dozens of DB round-trips). On a remote
Postgres/Supabase that re-derivation costs many seconds per message.

This is a tiny TTL + version-keyed memo. Entries are keyed by a caller-supplied
string and validated against a ``version`` token (the agent's ``updated_at``):

  * a hit returns instantly only if BOTH the version matches AND the entry hasn't
    passed its TTL;
  * any agent edit bumps ``agents.updated_at`` → the version changes → miss →
    fresh recompute. This is how invalidation works across MULTIPLE instances
    with no cross-process messaging: every instance reads the same ``updated_at``.
  * the TTL is a backstop for the rare edit that doesn't bump ``updated_at``
    (e.g. editing a shared tool's code), bounding staleness to ``ttl`` seconds.

It is deliberately dumb: a plain dict guarded by the GIL, no eviction beyond TTL
overwrite. The cached value sets are small (one per agent/user combo).
