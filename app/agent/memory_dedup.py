"""
Near-duplicate memory detection.

When an agent saves a *fact* to memory (the ``upsert`` action of the memory
tool), it may be re-stating something it — or a past session — already saved
under a different slug ("The user runs a bakery" vs "User owns a bakery
business"). Left unchecked, the memory store fills with many near-identical rows
for the same fact, which bloats recall and dilutes ranking.

This module answers one question, cheaply and backend-agnostically: *does a
semantically near-identical memory already exist under a DIFFERENT slug?* If so,
the caller updates THAT row in place instead of inserting a restatement — one row
per fact, newest wording wins (the behaviour an admin picked).

Design notes:
- **Backend-agnostic.** It uses only the public ``db.memory_search`` (already
  implemented for SQLite / Postgres / hybrid / Supabase) plus the in-process
  embedder. No per-backend vector SQL here.
- **Absolute similarity, not rank.** ``memory_search`` returns an RRF *rank*,
  which is a fusion score, not a cosine distance — useless as a duplicate
  threshold. So we take its top few candidates, then re-embed the incoming text
  and each candidate locally and compute a real cosine. Embeddings are in-process
  by default (no network, no API cost), so re-embedding a handful of short texts
  is effectively free.
- **Degrades to a normal insert.** If the local embedder isn't installed, or
  search/embed fails, this returns ``None`` and the caller just saves normally —
  dedup is an optimisation, never a gate on saving.
- **Conservative threshold.** The bar is deliberately HIGH (near-identical), so a
  genuinely different fact about the same subject is NOT merged away. Tunable via
  ``MEMORY_DEDUP_THRESHOLD``.
