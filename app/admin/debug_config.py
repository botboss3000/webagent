"""Consolidated debug knobs — ``data/config/debug-config.json``.

The app's debugging controls used to be split across two mechanisms: a couple of
environment variables read at boot in ``app/main.py`` (``LOG_LEVEL``,
``DIAGNOSTICS_CAPTURE_LEVEL``) and a handful of keys scattered through
``app-settings.json`` (run limits + the recorders/watchdog). This module gives
them a single home.

``debug-config.json`` is an **override-only** file: every knob defaults to
``null``, which means "leave it to the normal source" (the env var, the Admin
Tools > App Settings UI, or the built-in default). Setting a value FORCES it from
this file, winning over the normal source at the point each value is consumed.

So an operator who wants to crank up debugging edits one file; nothing else has
to change, and with the shipped all-``null`` file the app behaves exactly as
before. The file is tiny, so it is re-read on each call (the run-limit and
recorder/watchdog overrides therefore take effect live). The two logging levels
are read once at boot in ``main.py``, so changing those needs a server restart.
