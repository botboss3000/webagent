"""
UI Admin tools — file editing confined to the front-end (ui/, .css/.html).

Wires the existing rich source tools (read / write / edit / patch / delete /
search / list directory) behind `app/admin/ui_guardrails.py` so a "UI Admin"
agent can alter visual details only — never backend code, and never the shell,
Python, git, or server restart.

How it works: `inject_source_tools` builds the full filesystem toolset into a
throwaway dict; we re-expose only the file tools, each wrapped with a
`ui_guardrails.check_path` pre-check on its `path` argument. The guardrail is the
security boundary (project-root → ui/ → extension allow-list); the wrapper just
adds a sensible default of `ui/` for the search/list tools.

Gated by the `ui_admin` ability (see app/tools/loader.py). Delete this file (or
app/admin/ui_guardrails.py) to remove the capability.
