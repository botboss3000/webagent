"""WebAgent launcher — guarantees a SINGLE server instance on port 8080.

Why this matters: the live chat feed (WebSocket) and the running agent only
talk to each other through one process's in-memory listener list — there is no
cross-process event bus. If two servers stack on :8080, the OS splits incoming
connections between them: the browser's WebSocket lands on server A while the
"send message" request runs the agent on server B, so the live text is
broadcast into a process the browser isn't listening to. Nothing streams, yet
the answer still lands in the shared database — which is exactly the
"message partially appears / doesn't appear, but shows up after a session
switch" symptom.

Two distinct things can occupy :8080, and they need OPPOSITE responses:

  1. A LIVE server process is holding it. Response: kill it and wait until it
     is actually gone (take-over policy — a just-killed mid-turn run is
     recovered by the app's startup orphan-cleanup, so nothing is lost), then
     bind. A plain (non-SO_REUSEADDR) bind keeps a stray second launch from
     silently stacking: if our kill somehow fails, the bind fails fast instead.

  2. A DEAD predecessor's LEFTOVER SOCKETS are holding it. When a server is
     force-killed while browsers still have live WebSocket connections, Windows
     strands those connections (ESTABLISHED / FIN_WAIT_2 / TIME_WAIT) and even
     the LISTEN socket under the now-dead PID. There is NO process to kill, and
     a plain bind is refused (WinError 10048) until the kernel drains them —
     which can take minutes. Response: confirm no live process owns the port,
     then reclaim the address with SO_REUSEADDR. That is the only way to bind
     over the corpse's sockets, and it is safe HERE precisely because we only
     reach for it once we've proven no live server is there to stack on top of.

Telling the two apart is the whole game: we cross-check every PID that netstat
reports as LISTENING on :8080 against the live process table. A listener whose
PID is alive is case 1 (kill it); a listener whose PID is dead is case 2
(reclaim with reuse).
