"""Session Namer — a background APP FUNCTION (not an agent ability).

Auto-names a chat session ONCE from its first few user messages using a tiny
LLM call, then locks the name so it is never silently re-titled.
Pushes a live ``session_title`` event over the per-user WebSocket so the
chat-panel header shows a spinner while naming and swaps in the new name.

Failures are verified, not swallowed: a naming attempt only counts as a
success once the title is PERSISTED. A blank LLM result (after retries), a
write error, or a vanished session row is stamped onto the session's metadata
(``auto_title_failed`` / ``auto_title_last_error`` / ``auto_title_last_attempt_at``)
and recorded as a ``recovery``-category diagnostic, and the WebSocket always
gets a final event so the header never hangs on "generating". A bounded
recovery sweep (``start_sweep`` / ``stop_sweep``, leader-registered) re-triggers
naming for sessions still stuck on a fallback "New: …" title.

The model/client are RESOLVED, not read from env: the chat loop stopped
exporting the provider to ``os.environ`` (07-30, to stop concurrent chats
cross-wiring credentials), so env-based resolution silently no-ops on a fresh
boot. The namer resolves the session's provider config itself
(``apply_env=False``), exactly like the Auto-rename endpoint does.

As a TURN_HOOK app function, it exports ``TURN_HOOK`` — an async callable that
is dispatched from ``app/api/chat.py`` after every chat turn. This makes the
naming strategy swappable: toggle this app function off in App Settings ▸ App
Functions and enable a different one (e.g. "first-message only", "rule-based
naming", "no naming") to change behaviour without editing core code.

It also backs the on-demand "Auto rename" action (POST /sessions/{id}/auto-title):
called with ``force=True`` it re-names ANY session — even a locked,
manually-renamed, or optimizer-/closer-/slash- session — from a larger sample
of its user messages.
