"""Model Switcher ability — SELF-CONTAINED drop-in.

The single home for an agent changing THIS conversation's model at runtime. (The
image_vision ability deliberately does NOT switch models — it only reads images;
taking over on a vision/image-output model is done here via ``set_model``.)

Five tools — a read-only menu plus the switches:

  • ``list_models`` — the MENU the agent reads on demand: every enabled, runnable
    model with capability badges (sees images / makes images / premium tier), which
    one is running now, which is the default, and the reasoning-effort levels. This
    is what lets the agent switch by *capability* instead of memorising ids — it
    only needs a real model name to honour a user's explicit request. Read-only.

  • ``set_model`` — switch onto any *enabled, tool-capable* model: the user asked
    for a specific model, the agent wants a vision/image-output model for sustained
    image work, or it wants to drop back to the cheap default. Pass a model id to
    take over on it, or "default"/empty to revert.

  • ``use_premium_model`` — for a genuinely hard task the agent can UPGRADE
    itself onto the configured premium model (the row an admin assigned the
    *Premium* role to in App Config → Models; the role is stored per-model in
    the user's DB llm config as ``high_effort_capable`` and resolved through
    the same role-slot mechanism the chat footer picker uses —
    ``app.admin.settings._assign_slots`` with the legacy
    ``high_effort_targets`` resolver as a fallback). The premium model counts
    even when it is NOT enabled as an everyday brain, i.e. the "premium-only"
    pattern. If it's already on a premium model, this is a no-op. Pair it with
    ``set_model('default')`` to fall back to the cheap model when the hard task
    is done.

  • ``set_effort`` / ``reset_to_default`` — tune the reasoning depth for this chat,
    and drop both model + effort back to the agent's defaults in one call.

The switches write a per-session model override (sessions.metadata.llm_config) that
the loop resolves on the NEXT turn (app-default → agent → session). The spending
switches are DESTRUCTIVE (they can raise spend), but the loop exempts the
model-switch tools from the confirmation gate in BOTH plan and ask modes
(grep MODEL-SWITCH-EXEMPT in app/agent/loop.py) — right-sizing the model is core
agent behaviour, so the agent may switch freely; auto mode was never gated.
``list_models`` and ``reset_to_default`` are not gated either.

Drop-in contract: descriptor .json + build_tools()/TOOL_SCHEMAS/DESTRUCTIVE,
discovered generically by app/tools/loader.py. See plugins/abilities/_TEMPLATE.py.
