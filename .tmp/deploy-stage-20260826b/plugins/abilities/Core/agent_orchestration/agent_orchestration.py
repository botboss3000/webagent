"""Agent Orchestration ability — SELF-CONTAINED drop-in.

Everything this capability needs lives in this file (plus its sibling
``agent_orchestration.skill.md``): the FEATURE descriptor, the tool handlers, the
spawn/run/re-wake runtime, its own storage (a lazily-created ``agent_spawns``
table — no core schema edit, mirroring how the optimizer self-creates
``optimizer_runs``), and a background follow-up-timer poller. Delete this file
(and the .skill.md) and the whole capability is gone; nothing in core references
it by name.

It is discovered generically by core via three optional module hooks (see
app/abilities/__init__.py "Self-contained abilities"):
  • FEATURE                    — catalog + UI + which tool names it gates
  • build_tools(...)           — its tool handlers (app/tools/loader.py injects them)
  • start_background()/stop_background() — its poller (app/main.py runs it)

What it does: lets an agent act as an orchestrator — spawn purpose-built helper
agents in their own saved sessions, converse with them, run them blocking or
forked, and oversee forked work with durable follow-up timers. It also owns the
`delegate_to_agent` / `list_delegatable_agents` handlers IN-FILE (folded in from
the former app/tools/delegation.py — build_tools returns them alongside the
spawn/oversee tools, and the generic loader discovery injects them) and the
`run_optimizer` handler (folded in from the former core block in
app/tools/loader.py — same ability gate, same recursion guards).

    heartbeat is older than ``older_than_seconds`` has NO live runner on ANY

    We deliberately flip such orphans to 'error' rather than re-executing their
    task: a re-run re-does everything the spawn already did, INCLUDING re-spawning
    the sub-helpers it created, so auto-re-running a self-orchestrating tree
    snowballs one restart into an exploding fan-out. The caller re-wakes the
    orchestrator instead, which can deliberately re-spawn anything it still needs.

    MULTI-INSTANCE SAFE: the flip is an atomic guarded UPDATE stamping a unique
    ``claim_token`` (``heartbeat_at <= cutoff`` re-checked at write time, and the
    status→'error' transition is itself the guard). Whoever's UPDATE lands first
    wins the row; every other instance's WHERE then misses. The token tells us
    which rows WE failed, so only we notify their orchestrator. ``exclude_ids`` is

# therefore recovers its OWN forked spawns from the same poller — but recovery
# here means FAIL-AND-NOTIFY, never re-run. A spawn proven dead (a stale heartbeat
# ⇒ no live runner on any instance) is flipped to 'error' and its orchestrator is
# re-woken so it can deliberately re-spawn the work. We never re-execute the task
# automatically: a re-run re-does everything the spawn already did, INCLUDING
# re-spawning the sub-helpers it created, so auto-re-running a self-orchestrating

# via a loopback into this same server process; letting dozens run simultaneously
# exhausts memory and hard-kills the process (observed: ~6 crashes/16min under a
# heavy fan-out). So forked execution drains through a global semaphore: requests
# are never capped, but only this many run concurrently — the rest sit 'queued'
# and start as slots free up. Blocking (wait=True) spawns BYPASS the semaphore:
# they run inline under their caller, so they don't multiply concurrency, and
# throttling them would deadlock a deep blocking chain (each level would hold a
# slot waiting for a deeper level that can't get one). Tune via env.

        """Spawn a fresh CLONE of yourself to work on a task.

        A clone is built FROM SCRATCH — it does NOT inherit your persona. It runs
        on the platform's app-global baseline plus whatever directive you give it
        here, and it starts with EVERY ability OFF.

        - ``system_prompt`` — the clone's identity/directive, written by you. Leave
          blank for a bare fire-and-forget worker (baseline + task only).
        - ``abilities`` — a list of ability ids to switch ON for the clone (see
          ``list_abilities``). You MUST pick deliberately; nothing is on by default.
          A clone can only spawn its OWN sub-helpers if you include
          ``"agent_orchestration"`` here. You can never grant an ability you don't
          have yourself (the ceiling).
        - ``allow_destructive`` — list of tool names the clone may use even though
          they normally require confirmation. Off by default: a clone has no human
          to confirm, so confirm-tools are blocked unless you opt them in here. You
          can never give a clone looser permission on a tool than you have.
        - ``context_inherit`` — optional (default False): when True, the spawn
          receives a copy of your entire conversation history up to this point.
          It starts its first turn already knowing everything you know, so you
          don't need to recap. The copy is one-way — the spawn's later turns
          do not flow back into your session. Leave False for a clean-slate
          fire-and-forget worker.
        - ``output_contract`` — optional: the exact shape/length you want the
          result in, so it comes back small and uniform.
        - ``from_agent`` — optional: another agent/template id whose prompt text is
          pulled in for the clone to reuse as reference identity. (To hand the whole
          chat to a real other agent instead, use delegate_to_agent.)
        - ``model`` — optional: run THIS helper on a specific model instead of
          inheriting yours. Use it to match the model to the job: a vision model
          for a helper that must SEE (a screenshot, a webcam frame, an image), the
          high-effort model for a genuinely hard reasoning helper, or the cheap
          default for boilerplate. Must be one of your enabled, tool-capable models
          (call ``list_abilities`` to see them, grouped into available / high_effort
          / vision). Omit it to inherit your own model. Cheap-by-default: only
          escalate a helper to a pricier model when its task actually needs it.
        - ``wait=True`` blocks and returns the reply; ``wait=False`` (default) forks
          and re-wakes you with the result. ``check_back_minutes>0`` sets a timer.

        Returns the spawn_id.
