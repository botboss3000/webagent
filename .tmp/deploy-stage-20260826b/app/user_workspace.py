"""Per-user data home — one folder per user for chat-session inputs and outputs.

Everything an agent produces *for a user* (and everything a user sends *in*)
belongs under that user's own home so it never leaks into the project root or
mixes between users:

    data/user_data/<user_id>/
        files/          generic agent outputs (reports, docs, downloads)
        screenshots/    browser screenshots
        visuals/        (reserved) generated images
        uploads/        (reserved) inbound attachments
        <any room>/     any other named bucket an ability asks for

This module is just the **path math** — it computes/creates those folders,
sanitises the user id so it is always a safe single path segment, and builds the
public URL the chat UI can use to fetch a file. It writes nothing on its own; the
`user_files` ability (and the browser-screenshot tool) call in here so every
writer agrees on the same layout.

The base dir defaults to ``data/user_data`` next to the repo and can be
overridden with ``WEBAGENT_USER_DATA_DIR`` (parity with ``UPLOAD_DIR``). The web
server mounts that base at ``/user_data`` (see app/main.py), so a file at
``data/user_data/<uid>/<room>/<name>`` is served at
``/user_data/<uid>/<room>/<name>``.
