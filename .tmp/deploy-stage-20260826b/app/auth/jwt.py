"""JWT token creation and validation.

Signing secret (hardened 2026-06-28): the HS256 secret is NO LONGER a
hardcoded fallback. A guessable/committed secret lets anyone FORGE a token for
any user (including the bootstrap ``admin``), which defeats every downstream
auth gate. The secret is resolved at import (a synchronous, always-available
boot value) in this order:

  1. ``JWT_SECRET`` env var, if set — explicit operator override (e.g. to share
     one secret across a multi-instance deployment).
  2. A persisted, git-ignored file ``data/config/jwt_secret.txt`` — created on
     first run and reused on every restart so existing tokens stay valid across
     restarts and across sibling processes (server, TUI, subprocess token mint).
  3. Freshly generated with ``secrets.token_urlsafe`` and written to that file.

If the file can't be written (read-only FS, perms), we fall back to an
in-memory random secret for this process — still unforgeable, but tokens won't
survive a restart (everyone re-logs in). That degraded mode is logged loudly.
There is intentionally NO hardcoded default to fall back to.

Shared-deployment convergence (added 2026-07-04): the local file above is
PER-BOX, so a fresh deploy or a redeploy invents its OWN secret and instantly
invalidates every login pass a browser already holds (they look signed in but
every authenticated request 401s). To fix that, ``ensure_shared_jwt_secret`` —
run once at startup after the vault is active — reconciles this box's secret
with a single value stored in the SHARED secrets vault (the same vault the
deploy already configures):

  * vault already holds one  → adopt it (cache locally, swap the live secret),
    so tokens minted by any sibling instance validate here too;
  * vault holds none yet     → publish this box's secret so later instances and
    redeploys reuse it.

Because the deploy carries the shared vault, the signing key effectively travels
with the deploy — no separate carry needed. Unless ``JWT_SECRET`` is pinned
(then the operator owns sharing and we never touch the vault). Best-effort: a
vault error just leaves this box on its local secret until the vault is
reachable, and never blocks startup.
