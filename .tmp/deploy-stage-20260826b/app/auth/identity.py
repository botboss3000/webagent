"""Caller-identity verification helpers.

The auth middleware (`app/auth/middleware.py`) decodes the JWT on every
non-public request and stashes the subject's user_id on
`request.state.user_id`. It does NOT, however, enforce that the user_id
passed in the request payload (query param, body field, etc.) actually
matches that authenticated user — so without an extra check, an
authenticated user could simply submit a request claiming
`user_id=somebody_else` and the route would happily operate on that other
user's data.

This module is the single chokepoint for that check. Every API route that
reads or writes per-user state should call `assert_caller_is(request,
claimed_user_id)` before touching the DB. Global admins are allowed to
spoof user_ids (used by the admin tooling); everyone else must match.

WebSocket endpoints can't use this directly (no Request), but can call
`verify_token_matches_user(token, claimed_user_id)` on their handshake
payload to get the same guarantee.
