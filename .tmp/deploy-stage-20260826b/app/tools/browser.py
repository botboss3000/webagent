"""
Persistent browser manager for Playwright-based automation.

Maintains one browser instance per user+session so the agent can
navigate, click, type, scrape, and screenshot across multiple turns.

By default the browser is headless (invisible). If a visible app-mode Chromium
is running with a remote-debugging port open — e.g. the launcher's "App Window"
button (see launcher/webagent_launcher/app_window.py) — the manager ATTACHES to
that window over CDP instead, so the agent drives the same window the user is
watching. Close the window and it transparently reverts to headless.
