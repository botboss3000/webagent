"""
Run Manager — the server-side owner of every agent turn.

Why this exists
---------------
Before this, an agent turn was launched as a detached ``asyncio.create_task``
whose handle was never stored. Python is free to garbage-collect a task with no
live reference, which silently cancels it mid-run. Combined with the buffered
chat endpoint (which ran the loop *inline* in the request and died the instant
the client disconnected), that is why turning off a device, closing the browser,
or switching sessions could interrupt a run.

The Run Manager fixes this by holding a **strong, supervised reference** to each
running turn, keyed by ``session_id``. The run's lifetime is therefore tied to
the *server*, not to any HTTP/WebSocket connection. Nothing a client does
(leaving, refreshing, closing, switching devices) can reach it. The only things
that end a run are: it finishes, an explicit interrupt, or a server restart
(handled by orphan cleanup at boot — see ``StorageBackend.cleanup_orphaned_runs``).

Contract
--------
- ``start_run`` takes a zero-arg *factory* that returns the coroutine doing the
  actual turn (context build → agent loop → emit/persist). The manager wraps it,
  records run-state in the DB, and supervises completion.
- ``interrupt`` sets the DB interrupt flag the loop already polls, so the turn
  stops gracefully and persists its partial answer as 'interrupted'.
- ``is_running`` answers "is a run live right now?" from RAM
  (the DB ``session_runs`` table is the cross-process / cold-device source).
