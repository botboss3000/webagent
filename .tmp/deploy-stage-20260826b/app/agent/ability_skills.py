"""Ability-bundled skills.

A feature/ability can ship a skill alongside its tools by declaring ``skill``
(and optional ``skill_mode`` / ``skill_handle``) in its module-level ``FEATURE``
header. When that ability is enabled for an agent, its skill is folded into the
agent's ``# [SKILLS]`` catalog automatically — the agent always sees the
"when to use it" line and pulls the full body on demand with ``load_skill``.

Identity: ability skills are keyed by a **minted-once-frozen handle** (e.g.
``email_a1b2c3d4``) so they can never collide with agent-authored skills (which
stay name-keyed) and so a loaded ability-skill still matches itself across
restarts / conversation replay. The author sets ``FEATURE['skill_handle']``;
if absent we derive a stable handle from the feature id (deterministic, never
regenerated).

Phase 2 wiring. Fully guarded — any failure yields no ability skills rather than
breaking the prompt build.
