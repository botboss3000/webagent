"""
Run Manager — per-trigger supervisory contracts for agent runs.

The Manager is the JUDGMENT layer above the mechanical contract
(``app/agent/contracts.py``) and the mode gates (ask/plan/auto — which already
live in ``app/agent/loop.py``). It fires bounded, mostly-stateless LLM calls at
specific TRIGGERS, each with its own prompt and STRICT-JSON verdict envelope,
reusing the Output Closer's machinery (window collection, standard-role model
resolution, tolerant JSON parsing, durable rows, usage booking). Every trigger
is OPT-IN and gated on the ``run_manager`` app function (App Settings ▸ App
Functions; descriptor at ``plugins/abilities/System/run_manager/``).

Triggers (kind → verdict envelope):
- ``plan_gate``    — before the FIRST write/edit tool: does the run have a
                     plan consistent with the request?     {approve|block|revise}
- ``edit_gate``    — before a write/edit tool: does THIS edit match the
                     approved plan?                        {approve|block|revise}
- ``watchdog``     — periodic (every N turns) or on tool-error clusters:
                     is the run on track?                  {on_track|off_track|stuck}
- ``commit_gate``  — before ``commit_and_push``: does the change set match
                     the contract?                         {approve|block|revise}

The Manager window is deliberately LEAN: user + assistant TEXT plus the tool
call NAMES in order with placeholder outputs — never raw tool results. Commit
checks additionally receive a structured changed-path and verification summary.
The Manager judges only that supplied evidence, not hidden tool internals (see
``_collect_manager_span``).

Blocking vs advisory: ``plan_gate`` / ``edit_gate`` / ``commit_gate`` may run
BLOCKING (the loop awaits the verdict before executing the guarded action —
fail-open on timeout/error so a dead Manager never freezes the agent) or ASYNC
(a background verdict lands as a self-note the next turn sees). ``watchdog`` is
always advisory (async) and never sits on the critical path.

Actionable feedback is persisted as an assistant-side SELF-NOTE
(role='assistant', source='system:manager') that rides the DB tail into the
agent's next turn — the same pattern the audit send-back uses
(``output_closer._send_audit_back``). Non-actionable verdicts (approve /
on_track) are stamped onto the anchor assistant row (``manager_checked_at`` /
``manager_verdicts``) instead of writing a visible row, so the transcript stays
clean. Per-run checks have an overall cap (``manager.max_checks``, default 9)
plus per-trigger caps (``manager.max_checks_by_kind``), so a noisy gate cannot
starve the other supervisory lanes or rack up unbounded Manager calls.

Config — per-agent ``metadata['manager']`` (JSON):
    {"plan_gate": "off"|"async"|"blocking",
     "edit_gate": "off"|"async"|"blocking",
     "watchdog":  {"every_n_turns": 6, "on_errors": 3,
                    "on_stall": true, "cooldown_turns": 2} | "off",
     "commit_gate": "off"|"async"|"blocking",
     "max_checks": 9,

                              "watchdog": 3, "commit_gate": 1},
     "max_blocks": 3}
Prompts — per-agent ``metadata['manager_<kind>_prompt']`` first, then
``app_level_prompts.manager_<kind>.template`` in app-prompts.json, then the
built-in fallback — the same precedence chain as the closer's prompt.
